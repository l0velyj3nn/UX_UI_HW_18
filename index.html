        <h1>about me</h1>
        <p>I'm a catalyst for creative problem solving. I lead with empathy, and I believe that technology should make people's lives easier. If you need someone like me on your team, hit me up. Let's make the world a better place.</p>

    <section class="about-text">
        <p>My goal is to inspire people to try new things. I've been craft-failing forward for years, and I believe that failure isn't the opposite of success. It is part of it. I believe it is better to plunge ahead than to plan for weeks because learning by doing is a powerful tool. Every craft project I've messed up — sometimes with hilarious results — has been a stepping stone to being a better maker.</p>
        <p>It's amazing what 2 cans of silver spray paint and a quarter pound of purple glitter can do for a $10 thrift store artificial tree. Our craft, brewing, and homesteading projects have gotten our home listed on the "Place You Want to Hide Out When the Zombie Apocalypse Hits" for three years running.</p>
