          <p>Hi, I'm Jenn Alvin! I'm a multi-disciplinary maker who loves to learn new ways of making things - taking classes, watching videos, and trying stuff out on my own. Knitting, spinning yarn, sewing clothing, and leather-working are some of the disciplines I work in. Many of my projects use all sorts of reclaimed and recycled items.</p>
          <p>My goal is to inspire people to try new things. I've been craft-failing forward for years, and I believe that failure isn't the opposite of success. It is part of it. I believe it is better to plunge ahead than to plan for weeks because learning by doing is a powerful tool. Every craft project I've messed up - sometimes with hilarious results - has been a stepping stone to being a better maker.</p>
          <p>It's amazing what 2 cans of silver spray paint and a quarter pound of purple glitter can do for a $10 thrift store artificial tree. Our craft, brewing, and homesteading projects have gotten our home listed on the "Place You Want to Hide Out When the Zombie Apocalypse Hits" for three years running.</p>
